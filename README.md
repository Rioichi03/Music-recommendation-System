# Music Recommendation Engine
This project is a content-based music recommendation system designed to deliver personalized song suggestions based on user preferences and song characteristics. Using data from a comprehensive music dataset, the system leverages audio features and genre metadata to identify and recommend tracks that align closely with users' musical tastes.

The core methodology of this project involves CountVectorizer and cosine similarity techniques to quantify and measure similarities between songs. CountVectorizer translates genre text data into numerical vectors, effectively capturing genre patterns across different tracks. Cosine similarity is then applied to these vectors, allowing for precise similarity calculations between songs, which enhances the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. This combination of text vectorization and similarity metrics forms the backbone of the recommendation system, enabling it to recognize and suggest songs with similar stylistic elements.

To manage the computational complexity of a large dataset, this project utilizes data processing optimizations, selecting the top 10,000 most popular tracks based on play counts. This approach reduces processing time without sacrificing the diversity of music styles offered. After preprocessing, recommendations are generated by sorting songs according to their calculated similarity and popularity, ensuring that both well-known and genre-relevant tracks are highlighted.

In addition, various aspects of song data, including danceability, energy, tempo, and more, can be further explored for multi-dimensional filtering, though this project focuses primarily on genre-based recommendations.

## Features
• Personalized song recommendations based on genre and audio features./n \n 
• Efficient data handling through the selection of top songs by popularity.
• Utilization of CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to measure song similarity accurately.

## Future Directions
Future enhancements might include expanding to collaborative filtering for a more robust recommendation system that also incorporates user listening history and preferences, allowing for even more personalized results.
